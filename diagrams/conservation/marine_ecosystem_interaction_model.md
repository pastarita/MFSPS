# Marine Ecosystem Interaction Model

## Overview
This diagram models the complex interactions between Sea Palms and other elements of the marine ecosystem at the Middle Farallon Sea Palm Sanctuary, showing relationships, feedback loops, and potential management intervention points.

## Purpose
The purpose of this model is to visualize the ecological relationships that affect Sea Palm health and abundance, providing a scientific basis for conservation decisions and helping to predict ecosystem responses to various management strategies.

## Components
- Sea Palms
- Substrate conditions
- Water quality parameters
- Herbivore populations
- Competing algae species
- Human impacts

## Relationships
- Quantifiable factors:
  - Growth rates
  - Population densities
  - Nutrient levels
- Qualitative relationships:
  - Facilitation
  - Competition
  - Predation

## Design Considerations
- Relationships are color-coded to indicate positive, negative, or neutral interactions
- Feedback loops are clearly identified
- Decision points for management interventions are highlighted
- Potential outcomes based on different conservation strategies are shown
- Uncertainty in relationships is indicated where appropriate

## Integration Points
- Connects with the Conservation Impact Measurement Framework (System 14)
- Supports the Climate Change Adaptation Planning process (System 18)
- Informs the Sea Palm Propagation Initiative (System 33)
- Utilizes data from the Automated Kelp Monitoring System (System 1)

## Notes
- The model should incorporate both scientific literature and local observations
- Seasonal variations in relationships should be indicated
- Critical thresholds that may trigger ecosystem shifts should be highlighted
- The model should be designed to be updated as new research emerges
