# Climate Change Adaptation Planning

## Overview
This diagram presents a decision tree for the Climate Change Adaptation Planning process at the Middle Farallon Sea Palm Sanctuary, showing potential impact scenarios, assessment processes, intervention strategies, and feedback loops.

## Purpose
The purpose of this planning framework is to systematically prepare for and respond to climate change impacts on the Sea Palm ecosystem, ensuring the sanctuary can adapt management strategies as environmental conditions evolve.

## Impact Scenarios
- Temperature increases
- Sea level rise
- Storm frequency changes
- Ocean acidification

## Process Components
- Baseline monitoring data
- Climate projections
- Assessment processes
- Potential intervention strategies
- Implementation requirements
- Monitoring feedback loops
- Decision points for triggering interventions

## Design Considerations
- Decision points are clearly marked with criteria
- Different levels of intervention are shown based on observed changes
- Resource availability considerations are included
- Scientific consensus thresholds are defined
- Uncertainty management approaches are annotated
- Adaptive management principles are incorporated

## Integration Points
- Connects with the Conservation Impact Measurement Framework (System 14)
- Utilizes data from the Automated Kelp Monitoring System (System 1)
- Supports the Marine Ecosystem Interaction Model (System 10)
- Informs the Research Collaboration Workflow (System 5)

## Notes
- The planning process should balance proactive and reactive approaches
- Interventions should be prioritized based on feasibility and impact
- Indigenous knowledge should be incorporated alongside scientific data
- Communication strategies for climate impacts should be included
- The plan should acknowledge both gradual changes and extreme events
