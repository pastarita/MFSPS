# Conservation Impact Measurement Framework

## Overview
This diagram presents the timeline and dependencies for implementing the Conservation Impact Measurement Framework at the Middle Farallon Sea Palm Sanctuary, showing phases, workstreams, milestones, and critical dependencies.

## Purpose
The purpose of this framework is to systematically measure, evaluate, and communicate the effectiveness of conservation efforts at the sanctuary, providing evidence-based insights for adaptive management and stakeholder reporting.

## Implementation Phases
- Baseline data collection
- Indicator development
- Monitoring system deployment
- Data analysis methodology establishment
- Reporting system creation
- Stakeholder feedback integration

## Parallel Workstreams
- Sea Palm populations
- Associated biodiversity
- Water quality
- Human impact factors

## Design Considerations
- Timeline is clearly presented with realistic durations
- Dependencies between activities are explicitly shown
- Milestones for scientific validation points are highlighted
- Public reporting events are marked
- Framework revision cycles are included
- Resource requirements are annotated

## Integration Points
- Connects with the Sea Palm Conservation Database (System 3)
- Utilizes data from the Automated Kelp Monitoring System (System 1)
- Supports the Stakeholder Engagement Framework (System 19)
- Informs the Climate Change Adaptation Planning process (System 18)

## Notes
- The framework should balance scientific rigor with practical implementation
- Indicators should be meaningful, measurable, and manageable
- Both quantitative and qualitative measures should be incorporated
- The framework should be designed to evolve as conservation science advances
- Communication of results should be tailored to different stakeholder groups
