# Visitor Experience Journey Map

## Overview
This diagram maps the complete visitor experience journey at the Middle Farallon Sea Palm Sanctuary, from pre-visit discovery through post-visit engagement. It visualizes all touchpoints, decision points, and experience paths that visitors encounter.

## Purpose
The purpose of this journey map is to optimize the visitor experience by identifying all interaction points, ensuring educational value, maintaining safety, and creating meaningful connections with the sanctuary's conservation mission.

## Components
- Pre-visit touchpoints (website discovery, reservation system, educational materials)
- Arrival processes (check-in, orientation, safety briefing)
- Main experience paths (guided tours, self-exploration options, educational stations, observation decks)
- Decision points (where visitor paths may diverge based on interests or accessibility needs)
- Post-visit engagement (feedback collection, social media sharing, newsletter signup)

## Design Considerations
- The journey is presented chronologically from left to right
- Decision points are clearly marked with multiple outcome paths
- Digital and physical touchpoints are distinguished visually
- Accessibility considerations are highlighted at relevant points
- Educational opportunities are emphasized throughout the journey

## Integration Points
- Connects with the Visitor Reservation and Capacity Management system (System 9)
- Interfaces with the Educational Content Management System (System 8)
- Relates to the Mobile Application Architecture (System 21)
- Supports the Augmented Reality Educational Experience (System 23)
