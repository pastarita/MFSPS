# Research Collaboration Workflow

## Overview
This diagram illustrates the complete workflow for research collaboration at the Middle Farallon Sea Palm Sanctuary, from initial proposal to final dissemination of findings.

## Purpose
The purpose of this workflow diagram is to standardize and optimize the research process, ensuring high-quality scientific output while facilitating collaboration between various stakeholders involved in Sea Palm research.

## Process Steps
- Research proposal submission
- Review by scientific advisory board
- Approval processes
- Resource allocation
- Field work scheduling
- Equipment reservation
- Data collection protocols
- Preliminary analysis
- Peer review process
- Data validation steps
- Publication preparation
- Final dissemination of findings

## Stakeholders
- Researchers
- Sanctuary staff
- External reviewers
- Partner institutions

## Design Considerations
- Swimlanes are used to clearly delineate responsibilities of different stakeholders
- Decision points are clearly marked
- Feedback loops are incorporated at critical stages
- Digital platform facilitation points are highlighted
- Timeline expectations are indicated for major phases

## Integration Points
- Connects with the Research Data Management Lifecycle (System 22)
- Interfaces with the Staff Training and Certification System (System 16)
- Supports the Knowledge Management and Institutional Memory system (System 28)
- Links to the Educational Content Management System (System 8)
