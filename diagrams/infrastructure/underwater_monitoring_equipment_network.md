# Underwater Monitoring Equipment Network

## Overview
This diagram depicts the complete underwater monitoring equipment setup for the Sea Palm Sanctuary, showing the physical arrangement and communication pathways of all sensor nodes and supporting infrastructure.

## Purpose
The purpose of this network diagram is to provide a comprehensive view of the monitoring infrastructure that enables continuous data collection about the Sea Palm ecosystem, supporting both research and conservation efforts.

## Components
- Sensor nodes:
  - Water quality sensors
  - Acoustic monitors
  - Camera systems
  - Growth measurement devices
- Power sources:
  - Solar buoys
  - Underwater turbines
- Data relay points
- Maintenance access points
- Redundancy systems

## Design Considerations
- Physical arrangement around the sanctuary is accurately represented
- Different depths and monitoring zones are color-coded
- Communication pathways are clearly indicated
- Power distribution is shown
- Maintenance accessibility is highlighted

## Integration Points
- Connects with the Automated Kelp Monitoring System (System 1)
- Supports the Conservation Impact Measurement Framework (System 14)
- Interfaces with the Sanctuary Maintenance Management System (System 24)
- Provides data for the Digital Twin Implementation (System 20)
