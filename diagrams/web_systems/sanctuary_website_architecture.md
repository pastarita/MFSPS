# Sanctuary Website Architecture

## Overview
This diagram represents the comprehensive component architecture for the Middle Farallon Sea Palm Sanctuary website, showing both frontend and backend components and their interconnections.

## Purpose
The purpose of this architecture diagram is to provide a clear understanding of the website's structure, ensuring it effectively serves as the digital face of the sanctuary while supporting educational, research, and visitor engagement functions.

## Components
- Frontend components:
  - Public-facing pages
  - Interactive educational modules
  - Virtual tour system
  - Reservation interface
- Backend services:
  - Content management system
  - Data visualization API
  - Booking system
  - User authentication
- Data flows between components
- Third-party integrations:
  - Payment processing
  - Social media sharing
  - Mapping services
- Connection points to monitoring systems and research databases

## Design Considerations
- Components are organized by function and user access level
- Real-time vs. static content components are differentiated
- Security boundaries are clearly defined
- Scalability considerations are incorporated
- Accessibility requirements are addressed

## Integration Points
- Connects with the Educational Content Management System (System 8)
- Interfaces with the Visitor Reservation and Capacity Management system (System 9)
- Links to the Virtual Tour Experience Architecture (System 13)

## Notes
- The architecture should prioritize performance for media-rich content
- Mobile responsiveness should be emphasized throughout the design
- Content update workflows should be streamlined for non-technical staff
- Analytics integration should be comprehensive but privacy-respecting
