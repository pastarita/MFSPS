# Sea Palm Conservation Database Architecture

## Overview
This diagram represents the entity-relationship structure of the Sea Palm Conservation Database, which serves as the central repository for all scientific data related to Sea Palm specimens, environmental conditions, research activities, and conservation outcomes.

## Purpose
The purpose of this database architecture is to organize and relate all conservation data in a way that facilitates research, monitoring, and evidence-based decision making for Sea Palm conservation efforts.

## Entities
- Sea Palm specimens (location, health metrics, growth rates)
- Environmental conditions (water quality parameters, temperature logs, current patterns)
- Research activities (surveys, experiments, interventions)
- Conservation outcomes (population changes, ecosystem impacts)
- Genetic data storage
- Historical comparison datasets
- External database integration points

## Design Considerations
- Entities are connected with proper cardinality notations
- Primary and foreign key relationships are clearly defined
- Data validation rules are specified for critical fields
- Privacy considerations for sensitive research data are noted
- Temporal aspects of data collection are incorporated

## Integration Points
- Connects with the Research Data Management Lifecycle (System 22)
- Supports the Conservation Impact Measurement Framework (System 14)
- Provides data for the Visualization Panel System (System 7)
- Interfaces with the Citizen Science Data Collection Pipeline (System 12)

## Mermaid Diagram Type
Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

## Notes
- The database should support both structured and unstructured data types
- Version control for research data should be incorporated
- The schema should allow for expansion as new research parameters are identified
- Data export formats should comply with scientific data sharing standards
