# Visualization Panel System Architecture

## Overview
This diagram represents the class structure for the Visualization Panel System that implements a consistent approach for panel orientation and positioning throughout the Sea Palm Sanctuary's digital interfaces.

## Purpose
The purpose of this architecture diagram is to define the technical implementation of visualization panels that maintain consistent orientation and readability across various viewing contexts, enhancing the user experience for both on-site and virtual visitors.

## Classes
- Base Panel component
- Specialized panel types:
  - FloatingDialoguePanel
  - HistoricalTimeline
  - HistoricalDialoguePanels
- Positioning calculators
- Camera interaction handlers

## Key Methods
- Calculating horizontal offsets perpendicular to flow direction
- Maintaining consistent upward orientation regardless of local path direction
- shouldFlipText function (calculates dot products between panel normal vectors and camera direction)

## Design Considerations
- Inheritance relationships are clearly shown
- Composition patterns between components are defined
- Method signatures include parameter types and return values
- Critical algorithms are annotated
- Reusable components are highlighted

## Integration Points
- Supports the Virtual Tour Experience Architecture (System 13)
- Interfaces with the Augmented Reality Educational Experience (System 23)
- Connects with the Educational Content Management System (System 8)
- Utilizes data from the Automated Kelp Monitoring System (System 1)

## Notes
- The architecture should prioritize performance for real-time rendering
- Accessibility considerations should be incorporated
- The system should be adaptable to multiple device types and screen sizes
- Text readability algorithms should be thoroughly documented
