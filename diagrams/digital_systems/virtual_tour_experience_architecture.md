# Virtual Tour Experience Architecture

## Overview
This diagram details the component architecture for the Virtual Tour Experience system at the Middle Farallon Sea Palm Sanctuary, showing the technical components required for delivering immersive underwater experiences to remote visitors.

## Purpose
The purpose of this architecture is to create an engaging, educational, and accessible virtual experience of the Sea Palm ecosystem for those unable to visit in person, extending the sanctuary's reach and impact.

## Components
- 360Â° video capture subsystem
- 3D environment reconstruction pipeline
- Interactive navigation interface
- Educational content overlay system
- Multi-user synchronization for guided virtual tours

## Design Considerations
- Data flows between components are clearly shown
- Storage requirements for media assets are specified
- Streaming architecture for different bandwidth scenarios is detailed
- Integration points with other systems are highlighted
- Accessibility features are incorporated
- Platform compatibility considerations are addressed

## Integration Points
- Connects with the Educational Content Management System (System 8)
- Interfaces with the Sanctuary Website Architecture (System 4)
- Supports the Mobile Application Architecture (System 21)
- Utilizes data from the Underwater Monitoring Equipment Network (System 6)
