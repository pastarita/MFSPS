# Automated Kelp Monitoring System

## Overview
This diagram represents the complete data flow for the Automated Kelp Monitoring System at the Middle Farallon Sea Palm Sanctuary. It visualizes how environmental data is collected, transmitted, processed, analyzed, and utilized for monitoring the kelp ecosystem.

## Purpose
The purpose of this diagram is to provide a clear understanding of the technical infrastructure that supports real-time monitoring of the kelp forest ecosystem. It shows the path of data from collection to actionable insights, enabling both research and conservation efforts.

## Components
- Underwater sensor arrays (collecting data on kelp growth, water quality, marine biodiversity)
- Buoy relay systems (data transmission)
- Shore station (data reception)
- Central processing server (data processing)
- Data storage systems (raw and processed formats)
- Analysis pipeline (including machine learning components)
- Alert generation system (for anomalous conditions)
- Visualization endpoints (public dashboard and researcher interfaces)

## Design Considerations
- Components are organized by physical location (underwater, surface, shore, cloud)
- Data flows are clearly indicated with directional arrows
- Processing steps are shown in sequence
- Storage systems are differentiated by data type and access patterns
- Alert thresholds and conditions are specified

## Integration Points
- Connects with the Research Data Management Lifecycle (System 22)
- Feeds data to the Visualization Panel System (System 7)
- Provides inputs to the Conservation Impact Measurement Framework (System 14)
- Supports the Digital Twin Implementation (System 20)

## Mermaid Diagram Type
Flowchart (using subgraphs to organize by physical location)

## Notes
- The diagram should emphasize redundancy in data collection and transmission to ensure continuous monitoring
- Color coding should be used to distinguish different types of data and processing stages
- Critical monitoring parameters should be highlighted
- Real-time vs. batch processing paths should be clearly differentiated
