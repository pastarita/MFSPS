# Citizen Science Data Collection Pipeline

## Overview
This diagram illustrates the complete data flow for the Citizen Science contribution system at the Middle Farallon Sea Palm Sanctuary, from initial observation collection through validation, integration, and utilization.

## Purpose
The purpose of this pipeline is to effectively harness public participation in scientific data collection, enhancing the sanctuary's monitoring capabilities while providing educational opportunities and fostering community engagement with conservation efforts.

## Data Collection Channels
- Mobile app
- Website forms
- On-site kiosks

## Process Steps
- Observation collection
- Automated validation
- Human review processes
- Integration with main research database
- Utilization in ongoing monitoring efforts
- Feedback to contributors
- Integration into research projects
- Incorporation into public education materials
- Input to conservation decision-making

## Design Considerations
- Data transformation steps are clearly shown
- Quality control checkpoints are highlighted
- Feedback mechanisms to contributors are included
- Privacy considerations are addressed
- Data attribution processes are defined

## Integration Points
- Connects with the Sea Palm Conservation Database (System 3)
- Interfaces with the Mobile Application Architecture (System 21)
- Supports the Research Data Management Lifecycle (System 22)
- Links to the Educational Content Management System (System 8)

## Notes
- The system should balance scientific rigor with accessibility for non-scientists
- User experience should be engaging and educational
- Data quality assurance processes should be thorough but not discouraging
- Recognition for contributor efforts should be incorporated
- The value of citizen science data should be clearly communicated
