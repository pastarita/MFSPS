# Research Partnership Development Pipeline

## Overview
This diagram illustrates the complete process for identifying, engaging, and maintaining research partnerships for the Sea Palm propagation initiatives at the Middle Farallon Sea Palm Sanctuary, from initial outreach to long-term collaboration.

## Purpose
The purpose of this pipeline is to systematically develop and nurture research partnerships with academic institutions, conservation organizations, and other entities that can contribute expertise, resources, and innovation to Sea Palm propagation efforts.

## Pipeline Stages
- Partnership identification:
  - Needs assessment
  - Potential partner mapping
  - Alignment evaluation
  - Initial outreach strategy
- Engagement development:
  - Exploratory meetings
  - Shared interest identification
  - Value proposition development
  - Preliminary collaboration planning
- Partnership formalization:
  - Agreement structuring
  - Resource commitment planning
  - Intellectual property considerations
  - Timeline establishment
- Active collaboration:
  - Joint research projects
  - Resource sharing
  - Knowledge exchange
  - Regular coordination
- Evaluation and evolution:
  - Success metrics assessment
  - Partnership refinement
  - Expanded collaboration opportunities
  - Knowledge dissemination

## Target Partners
- Academic research institutions
- Marine conservation organizations
- Indigenous knowledge holders
- Technology innovation partners
- Funding organizations
- Policy and regulatory entities

## Design Considerations
- The pipeline is shown as a continuous cycle rather than linear process
- Decision points for advancing partnerships are clearly marked
- Feedback mechanisms are incorporated at each stage
- Resource requirements are annotated
- Success indicators are defined for each stage

## Integration Points
- Connects with the Research Collaboration Workflow (System 5)
- Supports the Funding and Financial Sustainability Model (System 15)
- Interfaces with the Knowledge Management and Institutional Memory system (System 28)
- Links to the Stakeholder Engagement Framework (System 19)

## Notes
- The pipeline emphasizes mutual benefit and shared goals
- Partnership diversity is prioritized across disciplines and organization types
- Both formal and informal collaboration mechanisms are included
- Knowledge sharing and public communication are integrated throughout
- Long-term relationship building is emphasized over transactional partnerships
