# Middle Farallon Island-Tethered Structures System

## Overview
This diagram details the complete technical system for the Middle Farallon Island-tethered structures being developed in collaboration with the US Army Corps of Engineers, showing design elements, anchoring systems, environmental monitoring components, and maintenance protocols.

## Purpose
The purpose of this system is to create stable, environmentally appropriate structures tethered to Middle Farallon Island that can support Sea Palm propagation efforts while withstanding marine conditions and minimizing ecological impact.

## System Components
- Structural design elements:
  - Anchoring systems
  - Buoyancy control
  - Wave energy dissipation features
  - Substrate materials for Sea Palm attachment
  - Monitoring equipment mounts
- Environmental monitoring systems:
  - Water quality sensors
  - Current and wave force monitors
  - Structural integrity sensors
  - Biological colonization cameras
- Maintenance access systems:
  - Service platforms
  - Safety features
  - Tool and equipment storage

## Technical Specifications
- Materials selection criteria:
  - Corrosion resistance
  - Biofouling management
  - Environmental compatibility
  - Structural integrity in marine conditions
- Engineering considerations:
  - Wave and current load calculations
  - Anchor point stress analysis
  - Maintenance accessibility
  - Service life projections
  - Failure mode analysis

## Design Considerations
- Structural components are clearly labeled
- Connection points to the island are detailed
- Environmental impact mitigation features are highlighted
- Monitoring system integration is shown
- Maintenance access routes are marked
- Safety features are emphasized

## Integration Points
- Connects with the Underwater Monitoring Equipment Network (System 6)
- Supports the Sea Palm Propagation Methodology (see separate diagram)
- Interfaces with the Digital Twin Implementation (System 20)
- Links to the Sanctuary Maintenance Management System (System 24)
