# Sea Palm Propagation Methodology

## Overview
This diagram details the complete scientific methodology for Sea Palm propagation at the Middle Farallon Sea Palm Sanctuary, showing all stages from collection of reproductive material to successful establishment of new populations.

## Purpose
The purpose of this methodology is to establish standardized, scientifically sound protocols for Sea Palm propagation that maximize success rates while maintaining genetic diversity and minimizing impact on source populations.

## Propagation Stages
- Reproductive material collection:
  - Timing considerations
  - Selection criteria for source plants
  - Minimally invasive collection techniques
  - Transport protocols
- Laboratory cultivation:
  - Spore release induction
  - Settlement substrate preparation
  - Controlled environment parameters
  - Early development monitoring
- Nursery phase:
  - Transitional environments
  - Growth monitoring
  - Stress resistance development
  - Selection for outplanting
- Outplanting:
  - Site selection criteria
  - Attachment methods
  - Protective measures
  - Initial monitoring
- Establishment monitoring:
  - Success metrics
  - Intervention thresholds
  - Long-term monitoring protocols

## Research Components
- Genetic diversity preservation strategies
- Growth rate optimization experiments
- Substrate preference studies
- Environmental tolerance testing
- Interaction with local species assessment

## Design Considerations
- Scientific process steps are clearly sequenced
- Decision points for intervention are highlighted
- Quality control checkpoints are included
- Data collection opportunities are marked
- Feedback loops for methodology improvement are shown

## Integration Points
- Connects with the Research Collaboration Workflow (System 5)
- Supports the Conservation Impact Measurement Framework (System 14)
- Interfaces with the Sea Palm Conservation Database (System 3)
- Links to the Wildtype Genetic Diversity Preservation Strategy (System 38)
