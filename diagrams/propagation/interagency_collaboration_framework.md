## Notes
- The framework should emphasize shared goals while respecting each organization's mandate
- Clear protocols for data sharing and intellectual property should be established
- Regular evaluation of partnership effectiveness should be incorporated
- Public recognition of all partners' contributions should be ensured
- The framework should be flexible enough to incorporate new partners as needed
