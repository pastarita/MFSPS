# Regulatory Compliance Framework for Sea Palm Propagation

## Overview
This diagram maps the complete regulatory landscape and compliance processes for Sea Palm propagation activities at the Middle Farallon Sea Palm Sanctuary, showing all relevant permits, approvals, reporting requirements, and regulatory relationships.

## Purpose
The purpose of this framework is to ensure all propagation activities comply with applicable regulations while maintaining positive working relationships with regulatory agencies, avoiding delays and ensuring environmental protection standards are met.

## Regulatory Agencies
- US Fish and Wildlife Service
- California Department of Fish and Wildlife
- California Coastal Commission
- National Marine Fisheries Service
- US Army Corps of Engineers
- California State Lands Commission

## Compliance Components
- Permit identification and mapping:
  - Required permits by activity type
  - Jurisdictional boundaries
  - Application timelines
  - Documentation requirements
- Application processes:
  - Sequential dependencies
  - Parallel submission opportunities
  - Review cycles
  - Response protocols
- Monitoring and reporting:
  - Data collection requirements
  - Reporting schedules
  - Compliance verification
  - Adaptive management triggers
- Relationship management:
  - Agency liaison roles
  - Communication protocols
  - Site visit coordination
  - Regulatory updates tracking

## Design Considerations
- Regulatory requirements are organized by propagation activity phase
- Application timelines are clearly shown with dependencies
- Decision points in regulatory processes are highlighted
- Reporting cycles are synchronized where possible
- Compliance verification checkpoints are marked

## Integration Points
- Connects with the Interagency Collaboration Framework
- Supports the Sea Palm Propagation Methodology
- Interfaces with the Conservation Impact Measurement Framework (System 14)
- Links to the Research Data Management Lifecycle (System 22)
