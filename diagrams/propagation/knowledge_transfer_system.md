# Knowledge Transfer System for Sea Palm Propagation

## Overview
This diagram illustrates the comprehensive system for capturing, organizing, sharing, and applying knowledge related to Sea Palm propagation across all partner organizations and stakeholders involved in the Middle Farallon Sea Palm Sanctuary initiatives.

## Purpose
The purpose of this system is to ensure that valuable knowledge about Sea Palm propagation techniques, research findings, and lessons learned is effectively transferred between collaborating organizations, preserved over time, and applied to improve propagation outcomes.

## Knowledge Types
- Scientific research findings
- Technical propagation methodologies
- Traditional ecological knowledge
- Regulatory insights and precedents
- Practical field experience
- Lessons learned from failures and successes

## System Components
- Knowledge capture mechanisms:
  - Research documentation protocols
  - Field observation systems
  - Collaborative workshop documentation
  - Interview and oral history collection
  - Failure analysis documentation
- Knowledge organization:
  - Taxonomic classification system
  - Cross-referencing methodology
  - Metadata tagging framework
  - Version control system
- Knowledge sharing platforms:
  - Secure partner portal
  - Public education materials
  - Training curriculum
  - Community of practice forums
  - Regular knowledge exchange events
- Knowledge application:
  - Decision support tools
  - Best practice guidelines
  - Training programs
  - Continuous improvement processes

## Design Considerations
- Knowledge flows between organizations are clearly mapped
- Barriers to knowledge transfer are identified with mitigation strategies
- Different knowledge types are appropriately handled
- Both tacit and explicit knowledge are addressed
- Knowledge validation processes are incorporated
- Feedback loops for knowledge improvement are shown

## Integration Points
- Connects with the Research Collaboration Workflow (System 5)
- Supports the Interagency Collaboration Framework
- Interfaces with the Knowledge Management and Institutional Memory system (System 28)
- Links to the Staff Training and Certification System (System 16)

## Notes
- The system values diverse knowledge sources equally, including traditional ecological knowledge
- Both formal and informal knowledge transfer mechanisms are incorporated
- Knowledge protection and appropriate sharing are balanced
- The system is designed to preserve knowledge through staff and organizational changes
- Regular knowledge audits are incorporated to identify gaps and opportunities
