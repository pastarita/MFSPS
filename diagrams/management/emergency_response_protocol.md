# Emergency Response Protocol

## Overview
This diagram details the complete emergency response protocol for various scenarios at the Sea Palm Sanctuary, showing the sequence of actions, communications, and decision points for different types of emergencies.

## Purpose
The purpose of this protocol is to ensure rapid, coordinated, and effective responses to emergency situations, prioritizing human safety while also protecting the sanctuary's ecological resources.

## Responder Roles
- Sanctuary staff
- Coast guard
- Medical personnel
- Visitor guides

## Emergency Types
- Medical incidents
- Severe weather
- Marine hazards
- Equipment failures

## Design Considerations
- Swimlanes clearly delineate responsibilities of different responder roles
- Event sequences are shown for each emergency type
- Communication flows are explicitly defined
- Decision points are highlighted
- Resource allocation processes are detailed
- Visitor management procedures are included

## Integration Points
- Connects with the Visitor Experience Journey Map (System 2)
- Interfaces with the Sanctuary Maintenance Management System (System 24)
- Links to the Mobile Application Architecture (System 21)
- Supports the Staff Training and Certification System (System 16)

## Notes
- The protocol should emphasize clear communication channels
- Regular drills and training should be referenced
- Integration with local emergency services should be highlighted
- Post-incident reporting and analysis workflows should be included
- Accessibility considerations during emergencies should be addressed
