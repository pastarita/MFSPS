# Visitor Reservation and Capacity Management

## Overview
This diagram illustrates the complete lifecycle of the visitor reservation system for the Middle Farallon Sea Palm Sanctuary, from available capacity to fully booked states and all transitions in between.

## Purpose
The purpose of this system is to efficiently manage visitor access to the sanctuary while balancing conservation needs, educational opportunities, and visitor experience quality through an organized reservation process.

## States and Transitions
- Available capacity
- Reservation creation
- Reservation modification
- Reservation cancellation
- Reservation completion
- Waitlist management
- Special group bookings
- Educational institution priority access
- Capacity adjustments based on environmental conditions

## Subprocesses
- Payment processing
- Confirmation communication
- Reminder sequences
- Post-visit follow-ups

## Design Considerations
- All possible state transitions are clearly shown
- Decision points for handling edge cases are included:
  - Weather cancellations
  - Capacity changes
  - Special events
- Automated and manual processes are distinguished
- Communication touchpoints are highlighted

## Integration Points
- Connects with the Visitor Experience Journey Map (System 2)
- Interfaces with the Sanctuary Website Architecture (System 4)
- Links to the Mobile Application Architecture (System 21)
- Supports the Sanctuary Zoning and Access Management system (System 17)

## Notes

- Capacity limits should be dynamically adjustable based on environmental conditions
- Group reservation handling should be streamlined for educational institutions
- The waitlist process should be transparent and fair
