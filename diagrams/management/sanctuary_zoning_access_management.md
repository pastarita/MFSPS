# Sanctuary Zoning and Access Management

## Overview
This diagram represents the entity-relationship structure of the Sanctuary Zoning and Access Management system, showing different sanctuary zones, their spatial relationships, access rules, and temporal restrictions.

## Purpose
The purpose of this system is to balance conservation priorities with research needs and visitor access by clearly defining zones within the sanctuary and managing access to these areas in a way that protects sensitive habitats while enabling appropriate use.

## Entities
- Sanctuary zones:
  - Core conservation areas
  - Research zones
  - Visitor access areas
  - Buffer zones
- Spatial relationships between zones
- Access rules for each zone
- Temporal restrictions (seasonal, tidal, etc.)
- Monitoring equipment placement
- Research activities
- Visitor pathways
- Special access permissions
- Temporary restrictions
- Approval workflows for access requests

## Design Considerations
- Zone boundaries and relationships are clearly defined
- Access rules are explicitly associated with zones
- Temporal aspects of access are incorporated
- Special permission processes are detailed
- Compliance monitoring and enforcement processes are included

## Integration Points
- Connects with the Visitor Reservation and Capacity Management system (System 9)
- Supports the Research Collaboration Workflow (System 5)
- Interfaces with the Conservation Impact Measurement Framework (System 14)
- Links to the Emergency Response Protocol (System 11)

## Notes
- The system should prioritize ecological protection while enabling appropriate access
- Zone definitions should be based on scientific assessment of habitat sensitivity
- Access rules should be clear and enforceable
- The system should allow for adaptive management as conditions change
- Educational opportunities about zoning purposes should be incorporated
