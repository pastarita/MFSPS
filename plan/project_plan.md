## Directory Structure

The project will be organized into the following directories, each containing specific Markdown files with Mermaid diagrams:

1. `/research/` - All research-related documentation and systems
2. `/conservation/` - Conservation strategies and implementation plans
3. `/education/` - Educational resources and program outlines
4. `/community/` - Community engagement and volunteer management
5. `/administration/` - Administrative systems and processes
