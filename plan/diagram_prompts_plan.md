# Synoptic Plan for Mermaid Diagram Prompts

This document serves as a central repository for the descriptions and prompts that will be used to develop detailed, high-level Mermaid diagrams for each system within the Sea Palm Sanctuary project. Each system listed below will have its own dedicated procedural Mermaid document.

The goal is to create individual, well-contemplated detailed diagrams for each system. These prompts will guide that development process.

## Instructions for Use:

1.  For each system section below, replace `[Name of System X]` with the actual name of the system you are planning.
2.  Under "Prompt for Detailed Mermaid Diagram," provide a comprehensive description. This description should be detailed enough to guide the creation of a procedural Mermaid diagram. Consider including:
    *   The main components or actors of the system.
    *   The key processes, flows, or interactions.
    *   Any specific relationships or dependencies.
    *   The desired level of detail for the diagram.
    *   The overall purpose or goal the diagram should illustrate.
3.  You can add more system sections by copying the template.
